Gnars' mission is to support aspiring <strong>CC0 artists</strong> and <strong>extreme sports athletes</strong> in their respective journeys. There are few other subDAOs with such a targeted vision. So far, Gnars DAO has funded several athletes, including the likes of Joe Atkinson, Dave Bachinsky, and Kevin Kowalski.</p>",

Instead of auctioning derivatives of Nounish NFTs, SharkDAO raises capital through selling a governance token, SHARK. With this capital, SharkDAO has been able to accumulate 6 Nouns, very early on in the Nouns DAO experiment. At its inception, SharkDAO's aim was to acquire Nouns as a group and vote collectively on Nounish affairs. Since then, the subDAO has been experimenting on various solutions to support Nounish builders and benefit Nouns DAO.</p>",
